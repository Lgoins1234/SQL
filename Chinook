In this section, I answered questions based off of the chinook database.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers;

SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees;

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers;

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
